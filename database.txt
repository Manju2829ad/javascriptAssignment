1. What is a database plain with an example on why we need a database?
A database is a collection of organized data that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated. Example: A library's catalog system is a database that stores information about books, authors, and borrowers.
Why we need a database: To efficiently store, retrieve, and manage large amounts of data, and to ensure data consistency, accuracy, and security.

2. Write a short note on file-based storage system. Plain the major challenge of a file-based storage system.
A file-based storage system stores data in individual files, each with its own format and structure. Major challenge: Data redundancy, data inconsistency, and difficulty in managing data relationships.


3. What is DBMS? What was the need for DBMS?
 DBMS (Database Management System) is software that manages and controls access to a database. Need for DBMS: To overcome the limitations of file-based storage systems, ensure data integrity, security, and provide a structured way of managing data.

4.Explain the challenge of file-based storage system which was tackled by DBMS.
Challenges:
Data redundancy and inconsistency
Difficulty in managing data relationships
Data security and integrity issues
Limited data sharing and collaboration
DBMS tackled these challenges by providing a centralized repository, enforcing data consistency, supporting data relationships, and ensuring data security and integrity.

5.List out the different types of classification in DBMS and explain.
Types of classification in DBMS:
Hierarchical DBMS
Network DBMS
Relational DBMS
Object-Oriented DBMS
NoSQL DBMS
Each type has its own data model, schema, and querying language.


6.What is the significance of Data Modeling and explain the types of Data Modeling?
Data Modeling represents the structure and relationships of data in a database. Significance: Ensures data consistency, improves data quality, and facilitates communication among stakeholders.
Types of Data Modeling:
Conceptual Data Modeling
Logical Data Modeling
Physical Data Modeling

7.Explain 3 schema architectures along with their advantages.
Schema architectures:
Star Schema:
Advantages: Simple, easy to implement, and fast query performance.
Snowflake Schema:
Advantages: Improves data integrity, reduces data redundancy, and supports complex queries.
3NF (Third Normal Form) Schema:
Advantages: Eliminates data redundancy, improves data integrity, and supports data independence.
